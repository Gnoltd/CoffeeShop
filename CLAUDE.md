# CLAUDE.md

Structural map of the PhaDinCoffee app. Full rationale lives in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-coffee-shop-app-design.md`. A full
implementation plan (DB schema/RLS/Edge Functions) is at
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-04-coffee-shop-scaffold.md` — not yet executed.

## Current reality vs. planned

**Real and running:** Next.js app (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind v4,
shadcn/ui), bilingual routing (next-intl), role-based middleware, the real
PhaDinCoffee brand theme (colors/font), and **every page in the app is now
real, interactive UI with mock data** — Landing, Login/Signup, the full
customer ordering flow (Menu/Cart/Checkout/Order Tracking/Order
History/Loyalty/Profile) with a real client-side cart, the table QR
identity flow, Food Cost Calculator, both staff pages (POS, Kitchen
Display), and all six admin pages (Dashboard, Menu, Inventory, Tables,
Staff, Settings). `npm run build`/`npm run dev` work. No page is a
translated-heading placeholder anymore — Landing, Login, Signup, Order
History, Loyalty, and Profile were the last six to be ported (see "Landing,
Auth, and remaining customer pages" below); everything before that in this
list was ported in earlier sessions.

**Not yet built:** Supabase database (migrations exist only as comment
stubs), Edge Functions, Stripe/VNPay integration, Realtime — every mock
data source in the app is waiting on these. See each feature section below
for exactly what's mocked and what's a documented (not hidden) gap.

## Stack

Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui + next-intl (bilingual
VI/EN), talking directly to Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Realtime) via its
SDK once the DB layer is built. No custom backend server — Row Level
Security (RLS) is the intended access-control boundary. Edge Functions will
handle logic needing secrets or atomicity (payments, order placement).

## Roles

`profiles.role`: `customer | staff | manager | admin`. Staff = fulfillment
(POS + Kitchen Display). Manager = Staff + menu/inventory/tables/reports.
Admin = Manager + staff accounts/roles + shop/loyalty settings.

## Bilingual (i18n)

- Library: **next-intl**, with locale-prefixed routing (`localePrefix: "always"`).
  Every route lives under `app/[locale]/...` — e.g. `/vi/menu`, `/en/menu`.
  Default/primary locale is `vi` (Vietnamese); `en` is the secondary locale.
- Config: `i18n/routing.ts` (locales, default), `i18n/navigation.ts`
  (locale-aware `Link`/`useRouter`/`usePathname`), `i18n/request.ts` (loads
  `messages/{locale}.json` per request). Wired into the build via the
  `next-intl/plugin` wrapper in `next.config.ts`.
- Translation catalogs: `messages/vi.json`, `messages/en.json`, namespaced
  by section (`Brand`, `Nav`, `Landing`, `Auth`, `Customer`, `Staff`, `Admin`,
  `FoodCost`, ...). Add new keys to **both** files. `Brand.name` holds the
  app name ("PhaDinCoffee") — identical in both files since it's a proper
  noun, not translated. Use it instead of hardcoding the name anywhere new.
- Server components: `getTranslations("Namespace")` from `next-intl/server`.
  Client components: `useTranslations("Namespace")` from `next-intl`.
- `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` is the true root layout (`<html lang={locale}>`,
  wraps children in `NextIntlClientProvider` with explicit `locale`/`messages`
  props — **do not** rely on implicit inference, it silently serves the
  wrong locale to client components). It also renders the global
  `<LanguageSwitcher />` (`components/shared/language-switcher.tsx`), a
  fixed top-right "VI | EN" pill that swaps locale via `router.replace(...)`
  while staying on the same page.
- `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` is set on the root layout —
  required. Without it, Next.js's route cache served identical (wrong)
  locale content across `/vi/*` and `/en/*` requests in testing. Since every
  route is behind auth-aware middleware anyway, static caching was never
  correct here regardless of the i18n concern.
- **Middleware is required for locale resolution, not just auth.**
  `requestLocale` (used by `getRequestConfig`/`getMessages`/`getTranslations`)
  is only populated correctly when `next-intl`'s middleware handler actually
  runs; disabling/removing `middleware.ts` for any reason (e.g. to test an
  auth-gated page) breaks translations app-wide, silently falling back to
  the default locale. If you need to bypass auth for local testing, do it
  by seeding real Supabase test data/sessions — never by hardcoding a role
  or removing middleware.
- Vietnamese-locale formatting helpers: `lib/format.ts` (`formatVND` →
  `"1.500.000đ"`, `formatNumber`, `formatDateVN` → `DD/MM/YYYY`,
  `formatPhoneVN`).

## Theme (`app/globals.css`)

Brand tokens wired into shadcn's Tailwind v4 CSS-variable theme (no
`tailwind.config.ts` — Tailwind v4 uses `@theme`/`:root` in CSS). Source of
truth: `design/stitch-exports/` (Stitch design system "Highland Red & Brown
Coffee"). Key tokens (light mode): `--primary` `#b3341f` (brick red),
`--secondary` `#6f4e37` (coffee brown), `--accent` `#c9a66b` (caramel),
`--background` `#fff8f2` (warm cream), `--foreground` `#3a2e22` (dark
espresso). `--destructive` (`#c1440e`, burnt orange-red) is deliberately a
different hue from `--primary` so brand red and error red don't look the
same. `--radius: 0.75rem` (12px). A `.dark` variant exists (brightened
primary `#e0533a` on dark espresso background) even with no dark-mode
toggle built yet, to keep shadcn's expected structure complete. Font is
**Be Vietnam Pro** (`app/[locale]/layout.tsx`, `subsets: ["latin", "vietnamese"]`),
wired directly to the `--font-sans` variable — don't reintroduce Geist.
When adding new UI, use the semantic Tailwind classes (`bg-primary`,
`text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, etc.) rather than hardcoding hex
values, so a future palette change stays a one-file edit.

## Route map

All paths below are relative to the locale prefix (`/vi/...` or `/en/...`);
folders are under `app/[locale]/`.

- `(marketing)` — public landing page (`/`)
- `(auth)` — `/login`, `/signup`
- `(customer)` — `/menu`, `/cart`, `/checkout`, `/orders`, `/orders/[orderId]`,
  `/table/[qrToken]`, `/profile`, `/loyalty`
- `staff` — `/staff/pos`, `/staff/orders`
- `admin` — `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/menu`, `/admin/inventory`,
  `/admin/tables`, `/admin/food-cost`, `/admin/staff` (admin-only),
  `/admin/settings` (admin-only)

`middleware.ts` composes next-intl's locale routing with role gating for
`/staff/*` (staff|manager|admin) and `/admin/*` (manager|admin, with
`/admin/staff` and `/admin/settings` further restricted to admin). It fails
open to "anonymous" (redirects to `/login`) rather than crashing when
Supabase is unreachable/unconfigured.

**Note:** `staff` and `admin` are real URL-segment folders (not parenthesized
route groups like `(customer)`) — Next.js route groups are invisible in the
URL, so parenthesized `(staff)`/`(admin)` groups would have collided with
`(customer)`'s bare paths (`/menu`, `/orders`). Caught and fixed during planning.

## Food Cost Calculator (`/admin/food-cost`)

First real feature built (not a placeholder). `components/admin/food-cost-calculator.tsx`
(client component) + thin `app/[locale]/admin/food-cost/page.tsx` wrapper.
Formula: `Food Cost Used = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory`;
`Food Cost % = Food Cost Used / Food Sales × 100`. Status thresholds: <28% good
(green), 28-32% normal (amber), >32% needs improvement (red). Fully bilingual
via the `FoodCost` message namespace; uses the shared brand (brick red
#B3341F, Be Vietnam Pro, shadcn components) rather than a separate palette.
Responsive: 1-column mobile, 2-column tablet (≥768px), 3-column desktop
(≥1024px) input grid; all interactive controls are ≥44px for touch.

## Customer ordering flow (`/menu`, `/cart`, `/checkout`, `/orders/[orderId]`)

Real, interactive pages ported from `design/stitch-exports/02-menu.html`
through `05-order-tracking.html` — not placeholders. Components live in
`components/customer/`. Shared layout: `(customer)/layout.tsx` renders
`CustomerHeader` (brand bar) + `BottomNav` (tab bar that hides itself on
`/checkout` and `/orders/[id]`, which have their own sticky action bar —
matches the Stitch mockups' "Destination Rule" for focused pages).

- `hooks/useCart.tsx` — real cart state (React Context + localStorage), not
  mocked. `addItem`/`updateQuantity`/`removeItem`/`clear`, computed
  `subtotal`/`itemCount`. Wrap any new customer page that needs cart access
  in the existing `CartProvider` (already in the customer layout).
- `lib/mock-data/menu.ts` — placeholder menu items/categories/sizes/modifiers
  until `menu_items` etc. exist in Supabase. Uses `nameVi`/`nameEn` directly;
  the planned DB schema only has one `name` column, so this needs a decision
  later (translation columns vs. Vietnamese-only content).
- Order Tracking (`components/customer/order-tracking.tsx`) shows a fixed
  mock status regardless of the URL's `orderId` — no `orders` table or
  Realtime yet. "Place Order" on Checkout clears the cart and navigates
  there; it does not submit anything anywhere. It now accepts a real
  optional `table` prop (from the URL's `?table=` search param, read by
  `app/[locale]/(customer)/orders/[orderId]/page.tsx`) and shows that
  number instead of a hardcoded one when present — see "Table identity
  flow" below.
- Checkout (`components/customer/checkout-view.tsx`) reads `activeTable`
  from `useTables()` — if the customer arrived via a table's QR code, the
  dine-in badge shows the real table number and it's appended as
  `?table=` on the Order Tracking URL. Falls back to a fixed mock number
  only if Dine-in is picked manually without ever scanning a QR code.
- Item "photos" are lucide-react icon placeholders in a colored box by
  default — `MenuItem.imageUrl` (optional) overrides this with a real
  `<img>` when set. No seed item ships with a photo (the Stitch exports'
  image URLs point at Google's internal AI-generation service and aren't
  stable to hardcode); real photos only exist for items an admin has
  uploaded through the new Add Item form — see "Product Detail Page" below.
- **Per-item order notes:** `CartItem.note` in `hooks/useCart.tsx`, entered
  on the Product Detail Page (e.g. "less sugar", "extra ice"). Note is part
  of `buildCartItemId`'s identity key, so adding the same drink twice with
  different notes creates two separate cart lines instead of merging and
  silently dropping one note. Shown in both Cart and Checkout's order
  summary as "Note: {text}". The quick "+" one-tap add on the Menu grid
  never sets a note (by design — it's the express lane for
  no-customization items, and skips the detail page entirely).
- **Back button:** `components/customer/header.tsx` (`CustomerHeader`)
  takes an optional `showBack` prop; when true it renders
  `components/customer/back-button.tsx` (client, `router.back()`) to the
  left of the brand mark. Only `(customer)/layout.tsx` passes `showBack` —
  `(marketing)` and `(auth)` layouts call `<CustomerHeader />` with no back
  button, since Landing/Login/Signup are entry points with nothing
  sensible to go back to. This also fixed a real dead-end: Checkout and
  Order Tracking hide `BottomNav` (Destination Rule) and, before this,
  had no navigation at all once you were on them.
## Product Detail Page (`/menu/[itemId]`)

Each drink/item now has its own real page, per the approved Stitch design
(project `4654820544595168289`, screen `bde2264a719d4f02b6086fa3d58d0c08`).
Tapping a Menu grid card (`components/customer/menu-browser.tsx`) navigates
here instead of the old inline expand-in-place panel — that panel is gone;
size/modifier selection, the note field, and Add to Cart all live on this
page now. The quick "+" one-tap add on the grid is unaffected (still adds
directly for items with no sizes/modifiers, bypassing this page).

- `components/customer/product-detail.tsx` (client) +
  `app/[locale]/(customer)/menu/[itemId]/page.tsx` (looks up the item in
  `lib/mock-data/menu.ts`, calls Next's `notFound()` for an unknown id).
  Hides `BottomNav` (added to `bottom-nav.tsx`'s `isFocusedPage`) since it
  has its own sticky Add-to-Cart bar — safe now that every customer page
  has the header back button (see below), unlike when this Destination
  Rule pattern was first introduced.
- Rating/reviews are mock, not real: `MenuItem.rating`/`reviewCount` (per
  item, in `lib/mock-data/menu.ts`) drive the star summary; the actual
  review list is `lib/mock-data/reviews.ts` — **one shared set of 3 generic
  reviews reused across every product**, not per-item content, and
  deliberately read-only (no submit form) since a real review needs a
  customer identity that doesn't exist yet. `components/customer/star-rating.tsx`
  is the shared 5-star display, reused on both this page and the Menu grid.
- **Gotcha:** this project's shadcn `Button` wraps **Base UI**
  (`@base-ui/react/button`), not Radix — there is no `asChild` prop. For
  polymorphic rendering (e.g. a `Button` that navigates), use Base UI's
  `render` prop: `<Button render={<Link href="/x" />}>text</Button>`, not
  `<Button asChild><Link>...</Link></Button>`. Base UI's `Button` also
  defaults `nativeButton` to `true`, which expects the rendered element to
  literally be a `<button>` — since `Link` renders an `<a>`, always pass
  `nativeButton={false}` alongside `render={<Link .../>}` or it logs a dev
  warning about lost native button semantics.

## Landing, Auth, and remaining customer pages (`/`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/orders`, `/loyalty`, `/profile`)

The last six pages ported from placeholder to real UI. All six were designed
in Stitch first: Landing/Profile/Loyalty/Login/Signup already had exports
(`01-landing.html`, `08-profile.html`, `09-loyalty.html`, `06-login.html`,
`07-signup.html`) from the original design pass that had never been ported;
Order History had no prior mockup, so a new screen was generated in the
same Stitch project/design system (`projects/4654820544595168289`,
screen `8436df098abc43ea801649f367476650`) before building it for real.

- **Structural change:** `CartProvider` moved from `(customer)/layout.tsx`
  up to the root `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` (alongside `TablesProvider`), so
  `components/customer/header.tsx` and `components/customer/bottom-nav.tsx`
  can be reused outside the `(customer)` route group. `(marketing)/layout.tsx`
  and `(auth)/layout.tsx` now both render the same shared `CustomerHeader`;
  `(marketing)` also renders `BottomNav` (matches its Stitch mockup, which
  shows the same tab bar as the rest of the app). `(auth)` deliberately does
  **not** render `BottomNav` — matches the Login mockup's explicit "No
  Bottom Navigation as per Transactional Flow Rules" note, consistent with
  the existing Checkout/Order Tracking "Destination Rule".
- **Landing** (`components/marketing/landing-view.tsx`, ported from
  `01-landing.html`): hero with headline + a real "Order Now" button
  (→ `/menu`) and a disabled+tooltip "Scan QR at Table" button (no
  camera-based QR scanning implemented — customers reach `/table/[qrToken]`
  by literally scanning a printed code with their phone's camera app, not
  from inside this app), a promo banner, a best-sellers horizontal scroll
  (reuses `lib/mock-data/menu.ts`), and category chips that link to `/menu`
  (not pre-filtered — `menu-browser.tsx` has no query-param filtering).
- **Order History** (`components/customer/order-history.tsx`, no prior
  mockup): filter pills (All/Active/Completed — Active = preparing/ready,
  Completed = completed/cancelled), 5 fixed mock orders with color-coded
  status badges, tapping a card navigates to `/orders/[id]`. Becomes a real
  Supabase query (+ Realtime for active orders) once `orders` exists.
- **Loyalty** (`components/customer/loyalty-view.tsx`, ported from
  `09-loyalty.html`): points hero card using the app's real agreed rates
  (10,000 VND = 1 point, 100 points = 10,000 VND off — not placeholder
  numbers), tier progress bar, a disabled+tooltip "Redeem Rewards" card (no
  rewards catalog table), a promo card, and a mock transaction history list
  with a disabled+tooltip "View All" (no pagination without a backend).
- **Profile** (`components/customer/profile-view.tsx`, ported from
  `08-profile.html`): avatar placeholder with disabled+tooltip edit (no
  upload backend), three real inline-editable fields (Name/Phone/Email —
  local state only, same pencil→input→save/cancel pattern as Admin Tables'
  rename), a menu list linking to the now-real Order History and Loyalty
  pages, a **functional** Language row (reuses the same locale-switch logic
  as `components/shared/language-switcher.tsx`), and disabled+tooltip
  Addresses/Settings/Logout rows (no addresses table, no customer settings
  page, and no real auth session to log out of, respectively).
- **Login / Signup** (`components/auth/login-form.tsx` +
  `signup-form.tsx`, ported from `06-login.html`/`07-signup.html`): real
  form state and a working show/hide password toggle, but the actual
  submit buttons (Log In / Create Account) and the Google buttons are
  **disabled+tooltip** — there is no Supabase Auth wired up yet, so a
  button that looked like it logged you in without granting any real
  session would be actively misleading. Re-enable these once Supabase Auth
  exists. Shared Google "G" icon lives in `components/auth/google-icon.tsx`
  (used by both forms, avoids duplicating the inline SVG).
- New translation namespaces: `TableLanding` (from the earlier table-flow
  work), `OrderHistory`, `Loyalty`, `Profile`; expanded `Landing` and
  `Auth`. All added to both `messages/vi.json` and `messages/en.json`.

## Staff pages (`/staff/pos`, `/staff/orders`)

Real, interactive pages ported from `design/stitch-exports/10-staff-pos.html`
and `11-staff-kitchen-display.html`, simplified to drop chrome that needs
real auth data (staff photo/name, shift stats) we don't have yet. Shared nav:
`components/staff/staff-nav.tsx` (brand name + POS/Kitchen Display links).

- **POS** (`components/staff/pos-terminal.tsx`) reuses `lib/mock-data/menu.ts`
  (same menu source as the customer app). Tapping an item adds it at base
  price directly — there is no size/modifier picker here yet, unlike the
  customer Menu page; that's a known gap, not an oversight, tracked in
  continuity.md. Local component state only (not `useCart` — POS is a
  separate staff-side transaction, not a shared persisted cart).
- **Kitchen Display** (`components/staff/kitchen-display.tsx`) is a 3-column
  board (New/Preparing/Ready) with a real ticking elapsed-time counter per
  order (`setInterval`). Advancing an order is local state only — becomes a
  Realtime subscription on `orders` once that table exists (design spec
  Section 3d).
- Both routes are still gated by the existing `/staff/*` middleware rule
  (staff|manager|admin) — confirmed the gate itself wasn't broken by these
  changes, but couldn't verify the pages' own rendering against a real
  authenticated session (no live Supabase yet, and no browser automation
  tool in this environment) — same caveat as the Food Cost Calculator.

## Admin pages (`/admin/dashboard`, `/menu`, `/inventory`, `/tables`, `/staff`, `/settings`)

Real, interactive pages ported from `design/stitch-exports/12-admin-dashboard.html`
through `17-admin-settings.html`. All admin routes (including the
pre-existing Food Cost Calculator) now share one left-sidebar shell:
`components/admin/admin-sidebar.tsx` + `app/[locale]/admin/layout.tsx`
(replaced the old plain top-nav). Dropped the mockups' fake admin-profile
header for the same reason as staff — no real auth data yet.

- `components/admin/{dashboard-view,menu-management,inventory-management,tables-management,staff-accounts,settings-view}.tsx`
  — one component per page, each with its own local mock data (Menu
  Management reuses `lib/mock-data/menu.ts`; the rest define their mocks
  inline since nothing else needs them).
- **Convention for not-yet-backed actions:** every "Add X" button
  (Tables/Staff) is rendered `disabled` with an explanatory `title`
  tooltip ("Not implemented yet — no `<table>` to write to") rather than
  silently doing nothing or faking success — keep this pattern for any new
  admin action that has no real table to persist to yet. **Menu's "Add New
  Item" is the one exception** (see below) — adding to `MenuManagement`'s
  own local item list needs no real table, so it's implemented for real
  like the other local-state actions, not disabled.
- Actions that only need **local** state (no persistence) are implemented
  for real, not stubbed: Menu's availability toggle + delete + **Add New
  Item** (`components/admin/menu-item-form.tsx` — a real modal with a
  working drag-and-drop/browse-from-computer image picker using
  `URL.createObjectURL`; saved items are prepended to `MenuManagement`'s
  local state with a real `imageUrl`, matching what the Menu grid and
  Product Detail Page render for that item in the same browser session —
  resets on reload, like every other admin mock mutation. No per-row
  "Edit" yet — out of scope for this pass, same reasoning as before),
  Inventory's restock (increments stock and flips the status badge),
  Tables' rename and QR token regeneration (via the shared `useTables()`
  hook — see "Table identity flow" below), Staff's activate/deactivate
  toggle, Settings' save (shows a real confirmation, doesn't persist).
- Dashboard's KPI numbers, chart, best-sellers, and low-stock table are
  fixed mock data matching the approved Stitch example values — no
  analytics query yet.
- All six routes remain behind the existing `/admin/*` middleware rule
  (manager|admin, with `/admin/staff` and `/admin/settings` admin-only) —
  confirmed the gate still works for every route (including Food Cost)
  after the layout change; same rendering-verification caveat as
  staff/customer pages (no live Supabase session, no browser automation
  tool here).

## Table identity flow (`/table/[qrToken]` → Checkout → Order Tracking)

Connects an admin-renamed table's identity all the way through to a
customer's order, entirely client-side (no `tables` table yet).

- `hooks/useTables.tsx` — `TablesProvider` + `useTables()`, mounted app-wide
  in `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` (outside/around everything, so both the
  admin and customer sides share one source of truth). Holds the table
  list (`{ id, number, qrToken }[]`, seeded with demo tokens `table-1`
  through `table-6` so the flow is testable by visiting `/vi/table/table-1`
  directly) and the current `activeTable` session. Both persist to
  `localStorage` independently (`phadincoffee-tables`,
  `phadincoffee-active-table`) with the same hydrate-then-persist pattern
  as `useCart`. `setActiveTableByToken(token)` looks up a table by its QR
  token, sets it as the active session, and returns it (or `null` if the
  token doesn't match any table).
- `components/customer/table-landing.tsx` — client component rendered by
  `/table/[qrToken]`. Calls `setActiveTableByToken` on mount; shows a
  "You're ordering at Table N" screen with a "View Menu" button on success,
  or an "Invalid Table Code" screen with a link back to the menu if the
  token doesn't match (e.g. a stale/regenerated QR code).
- Checkout reads `activeTable` and shows/forwards the real number (see
  "Customer ordering flow" above).
- Admin Tables' rename (`components/admin/tables-management.tsx`) writes
  through the same hook, so renaming "Table 3" to e.g. "Patio 1" is
  immediately what a customer sees after scanning that table's QR code.
- Gap, documented not hidden: token regeneration doesn't invalidate a
  currently-active session client-side (mirrors how a real QR reprint
  wouldn't affect an order already in progress) — becomes moot once real
  `tables` rows + RLS exist.

## Database (`supabase/migrations/`)

Not yet built — files are still comment-only placeholders in intended apply
order: `0001_identity_and_roles` → `0002_shop_config` → `0003_menu` →
`0004_inventory` → `0005_orders` → `0006_payments_and_loyalty` →
`0007_handle_order_paid`. Full entity list: spec Section 2. Full SQL for
every migration already exists in the plan doc's Tasks 3–9.

## Edge Functions (`supabase/functions/`)

Not yet built — `place-order`, `stripe-webhook`, `vnpay-ipn`, `vnpay-return`
are still comment-only `index.ts` stubs. Full handler code (with tests) is
in the plan doc's Task 11.

## Building the rest

All `design/stitch-exports/*.html` pages have been ported — there is no
remaining frontend UI to port from Stitch. What's left is backend: follow
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-04-coffee-shop-scaffold.md` for the
DB/RLS/Edge Function tasks (unaffected by the frontend/i18n work), then go
through every component listed in this file's feature sections and replace
its mock data with real Supabase queries (+ Realtime where noted). When
adding any genuinely new page/feature beyond what's already built, follow
the same pattern used throughout: shared brand tokens (no hardcoded hex),
`useTranslations`/`getTranslations` for every label with both
`messages/vi.json` and `messages/en.json` updated together, Base UI's
`render` prop (not `asChild`) for polymorphic Buttons, and the "disabled +
tooltip" convention for any action with no backing table yet.
