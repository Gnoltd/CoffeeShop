# Open / not started

1. **"Neubrutalist Modern" full-app redesign — all 4 phases shipped to
   `main`, live verification is the one remaining step.**
   Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-elevated-warm-redesign-design.md`
   (title says "Elevated Warm" but the actual locked style is
   Neubrutalist Modern — thick ink-colored borders, flat hard-offset
   shadows that collapse on press, first-ever dark mode; see the spec's
   revision note). Validated via 8 full interactive HTML mockups
   (Artifacts, ephemeral to that conversation, not in the repo) with
   live pixel-level iteration, not static wireframes, before any real
   code was touched.
   - **Phase 1** (plan: `...phase1-foundation-landing-menu.md`, pushed `934e72c`):
     design tokens, working dark mode (`hooks/useTheme.tsx`,
     `ThemeToggle`, no-flash init script), additive `neubrutal` variant
     on shared `Button`/`Badge`, Landing + Menu.
   - **Phase 2** (plan: `...phase2-cart-orders-profile-loyalty.md`, pushed `099133b`):
     Cart, Checkout, Order Tracking, Order History, Profile, Loyalty.
     Fixed `components/motion/step-progress.tsx` so a completed step
     shows a green checkmark instead of its own icon re-colored.
   - **Phase 3** (plan: `...phase3-pos-kds.md`, pushed `b9af9aa`):
     `StaffNav`, POS, all five KDS components, at the denser
     `nb-border-sm`/`nb-shadow-sm` Staff/Admin scale.
   - **Phase 4** (plan: `...phase4-admin.md`, pushed `7090e90`): Admin
     sidebar/mobile drawer + all 8 views (Dashboard, Menu Mgmt,
     Inventory, Tables, Food Cost, Shift, Staff, Settings).
   `tsc --noEmit` and the full test suite (140 tests) passed after every
   task across all four phases — no regressions to the underlying
   business logic anywhere.
   **Three assumptions from the design spec turned out wrong once
   grounded against the real code** (worth remembering as a pattern —
   mockup-review findings don't always carry over to the real
   codebase): the Cart+Checkout/Tracking+History/Profile+Loyalty
   tab-switcher pairing was a mockup-review convenience only, not a
   real navigation change (all six stayed separate routes); the
   "POS/KDS/Admin app-switcher" was already shipped as
   `components/staff/staff-nav.tsx`, not new UI; and Shift's Cash/Card/
   VNPay breakdown already existed in `shift-report-detail.tsx`, not
   outstanding work. All three were corrected in the relevant phase's
   plan doc rather than built again from scratch.
   **The one remaining step**: live-verify the whole redesign on
   **https://phadincoffee.vercel.app** — colors, dark mode toggle/
   persistence, both locales, real mobile devices (iOS Safari + Android
   Chrome, not just a resized desktop browser) — across all pages in
   one pass now that everything is shipped, per the spec's own
   verification plan. Deliberately deferred across all four phases by
   explicit user request; do it as a single pass, not phase-by-phase.

2. **Live-verify the Admin Dashboard by hand** — KPIs are real
   (`get_dashboard_stats()`, migration `0026`), but a full manual
   walkthrough hasn't been confirmed: real KPI numbers (cross-check
   Orders Today against Staff Order History), the 7-day chart's
   bars/weekday labels, Best Sellers reflecting real orders, a
   Realtime update after placing a new paid order, and the Excel
   export (all 5 sheets, correct Vietnamese text, real numeric cells
   for revenue/quantity columns — not text). Two automated attempts at
   this check (cloud routine, 2026-07-10/11) both stalled without
   landing a result — try a manual pass instead of another automated
   retry.
3. **Shift closing feature — live verification not confirmed done.**
   Code for Tasks 1-4 is committed and pushed (`shifts` table +
   `orders.paid_at` + RPCs, query layer, i18n, `/admin/shift` page +
   nav entries), but Task 5 (live-verify the open/report/close flow +
   this file's entry) has no recorded evidence of having run. Same two
   stalled automated attempts as item 1 above. Plan:
   `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-10-shift-closing.md`.
4. **Set the real tax rate.** Admin Settings now genuinely persists
   (migration `0042`, 2026-07-11) and POS/checkout both apply
   `shop_settings.tax_rate` for real — but it's deliberately left at
   `0` since no real rate was ever specified (previously a hardcoded,
   never-actually-charged `8%` in POS only). Set the real rate via
   `/admin/settings` whenever convenient — also a good moment to fill
   in shop name/address/phone/hours, which were never persisted either.
5. **Forgot password — real-email round trip unconfirmed.** Shipped and
   live-verified end-to-end except for the actual emailed link: request
   flow (email entry → "check your email" screen, works regardless of
   whether the address is registered), navigation between views, and
   `/reset-password`'s expired-link handling with no valid session all
   confirmed live. Clicking a real reset email, setting a new password,
   and confirming login with it afterward hasn't been confirmed — same
   documented shared-email-sender rate-limit risk as signup confirmation
   and Google-linking. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-11-forgot-password.md`.

## Known gaps (documented, not hidden — pick up whenever that area is next touched)

- `VNPAY_RETURN_URL` (synced to Vercel) is dead — VNPay's actual return
  URL is built dynamically in `place-order` pointing at the Supabase
  function URL instead. Worth removing the unused Vercel var, or
  documenting why it's kept, next time env vars are audited.
- `next build` still prints the "middleware deprecated, use proxy"
  warning (Next.js 16.2.10). Renaming `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` also
  touches `lib/middleware-rules.ts`, which it depends on. Not urgent.
- No Vitest/RTL coverage beyond the `lib/supabase/*.ts` query layers and
  `lib/middleware-rules.ts`/`lib/get-current-role.ts` — component-level
  tests were never added (skipped so far, not a regression).
- POS (`components/staff/pos-terminal.tsx`) always collects payment in
  person (`paymentCollected: true`) — Pay Later is a self-checkout-only
  concept, deliberately (POS staff are standing right there).
- A **pickup** Pay Later order sitting at `served`/unpaid has no
  staff-side "Mark Cash"/"Undo" surface (unlike dine-in's table card in
  KDS) — only the customer's own tracking page can choose/change a
  method for it. Pickup has no table to attach that control to.

Two throwaway test accounts (staff/customer roles, credentials in
`.env.local` and the gitignored `test-accounts.md`) are kept
deliberately for the user's ongoing manual testing — not a cleanup gap,
don't remove or flag these.
